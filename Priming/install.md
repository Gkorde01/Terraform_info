Add to PATH:

Open File Explorer, right-click on "This PC" or "Computer," and select "Properties."
Click on "Advanced system settings" and then "Environment Variables."
Under "System variables," find the "Path" variable, select it, and click "Edit."
Click "New" and add the path where you extracted terraform.exe.
Click "OK" to close all dialog boxes.
Verify Installation:

Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type terraform --version. You should see the version number of Terraform displayed.
For macOS:
Using Homebrew:

Open Terminal and run:
bash
Copy code
brew install terraform

Type terraform --version in Terminal. You should see the Terraform version.
Alternative (Manual Installation):

Download Terraform:

Visit the Terraform downloads page.
Download the appropriate zip file for macOS (terraform_*.zip).
Extract the Zip File:

Extract the downloaded zip file. You’ll get a terraform binary.
Move to /usr/local/bin:

Move the binary to /usr/local/bin for global access:
bash
Copy code
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
Verify Installation:

Run terraform --version in Terminal to check the installed version.
For Linux:
Download Terraform:

Visit the Terraform downloads page.
Download the appropriate zip file for Linux (terraform_*.zip).
Extract the Zip File:

Use unzip to extract the downloaded file:
bash
Copy code
unzip terraform_*.zip
Move the Binary:

Move the terraform binary to /usr/local/bin:
bash
Copy code
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
Verify Installation:

Run terraform --version in the terminal to confirm the installation.
Using a Package Manager (Optional):
For Linux distributions that support package managers like APT or YUM, you can often find Terraform packages in third-party repositories or through official HashiCorp repositories. For example:

Debian/Ubuntu:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/hashicorp.gpg
sudo apt-add-repository "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/hashicorp.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install terraform
RHEL/CentOS:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform
With Terraform installed, you’re ready to start defining and managing your infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code!
